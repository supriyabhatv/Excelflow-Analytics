## Project Name: Demographic and Financial Analysis across Cities

### Objective:The project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of demographic and financial data in cities, focusing on age groups, income levels, and expenditure patterns. By profiling these factors, the objective is to uncover trends, identify economic disparities, and inform urban planning and policy decisions. 

### About Dataset:
The dataset comprises several columns that provide information on a different aspect of a populatuon:
- Name : This column likely contains individual names, identifying each record in the dataset.
- City : Indicates the city associated with each individual, providing a geographical context for the analysis.
- Under 25 : Represents the count of individuals under the age of 25.
- Adults 25-60 : Contains data on the count of individuals aged between 25 and 60 years.
- Seniors 60+ : Indicates the count of individuals aged 60 and above.
- Average Income : Provides average income of the individual.
- Total Expenditure : Indicates total spending of individual.

### Cleaning and Preprocessing the Data:
For this project, we performed data analysis using Excel. Here's what I did:
- Utilized Excel's filtering feature to identify null values and irregularities in the data.
- Used Excel's conditional formatting to visually highlight duplicate values in the dataset.

### Creating Dashboard:Used pivot tables to transform raw data into actionable insights, allowing for easy exploration and analysis
- Age grops in each city : The age group dashboard provides a visual representation of population distribution across different age categories in each city. Using intuitive charts and graphs, enabling insights into the distribution of individuals unser 25, adults aged 25-60 and seniors aged 60 and above.
- Citywise Breakdown of Total Expenditure : Through interactive charts, it provides a detailed analysis of how expenditure is distributed in different regions.This breakdown enables us to identify cities with higher or lower expenditures, facilatiting a nuanced understanding of economic activities.
- Trend of average income across different cities : The trend analysis of average income across different cities visually represents how the average income levels have evolved over time.Utilizing stacked Bar chart, it illustrates the changes in income trends for each city.This dynamic dashboard allows us to identify cities experiencing significant income growth or decline.
- Average income vs Total expenditure : The dashboard comparing average income to total expenditure provides a valuable insights into the financial dynamics of each city.This comparision helps in assessing the financial health of cities, understanding if spending aligns with income levels and pinpointing potential areas for economic optimization or intervention.

### Insights :
- Across all cities, the data indicates a predominant presence of the adult age group (25-60 years) in comparision to other age groups. City_7 stands out having a significant concentration of adults.
- City_10 exhibits a noteworthy distinction in terms of total expenditure, as it surpasses other cities in terms of overall spending.
- The City_4 stands out with highest average income among all cities.
- Further reinforcing the observation, it's notable that City_10 not only leads in total expenditure but also holds the highest position in terms of total expenditure among all cities.

### Conclusion :
These insights provide a concise overview of the key findings related to age group distribution, total expenditure, and average income in different cities. They lay the groundwork for deeper analysis and potential implications for decision-making and resource allocation in each city.
